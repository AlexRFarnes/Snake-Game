## General info

A retro styled fully functional game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Just like the snake game from your good ol' nokia. The snake grows as it eats more apples, and also the speed of it. And just to make it even more nostalgic, the game is retro inspired by arcades with their neon and flashy colors.
